# Milton's Quakeworld Setup

This is Milton's (https://www.quakeworld.nu/wiki/Milton) portable standalone Quakeworld setup for competitive play. I don't own copyrights for most of the stuff in this package. I've tried to include as many license info files as I've found. Let me know if you want me to add some copyright info or remove something from the package.

## How to use
1. Make a clone of this repository
2. Find textures from the amazing Quake Retexturing Project (use your favorite search engine) and add them to the quake package cloned in section #1. I've converted mine from .tga to .jpg to make map load time shorter. I also made a .pk3 file out (QRP_map_textures_v.1.00_jpg.pk3) of the QRP textures to keep everything neat and simple in my Quake folder. Put that pk3 file in your ezquake folder or the textures in qw/textures folder.
3. Add pak1.pak and maps to folders id1 and qw/maps respectively. Instead of pak1.pak it's possible to use GPL alternatives for dmX maps that are downloadable here: https://github.com/nQuake/distfiles/tree/master/sv-gpl/qw/maps.
4. Profit or ask for help at Quake.World Discord.
