<h1><a href="index.html">ezQuake Manual</a>: Radar &amp; team hold statistics hud items</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Radar is a hud item that displays a picture of the current map and then 
plots the players on it during demo playback or when spectating (and in the 
future hopefully when watching QTV).</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>First of all the radar only works in GLQUAKE.</p>
<p>For the radar to work properly you need to be watching a MVD that hasn&#39;t 
been converted from a QWD demo. This is because an  MVD contains all the information 
for all the players on the map at all times, such as ammo, position, health and so on. 
When you&#39;re spectating or watching QWD&#39;s on the other hand, only the information that
is needed to display what your &quot;current view&quot; is available, that is, the information of the players 
closest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also need a radar picture for each level that you want the radar to work on that you put in
your <b>qw/radar</b> directory.</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<h3>Showing and placing</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>scr_newhud 1</dt>
		<dd>Enables showing hud items.</dd>
	<dt>show radar</dt>
		<dd>Shows the radar hud item.</dd>
	<dt>place radar screen</dt>
		<dd>Places the radar on the screen area.</dd>
	<dt>align radar right top</dt>
		<dd>Aligns the radar to right top.</dd>
	<dt>move radar -20 5</dt><dd>Moves the radar 20 pixels to the left and 5 down.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Place the radar where you want it on screen using align, move and place. (For 
more information about this, check the general <a href="index8eaa.html?hud">HUD manual page</a>.)</p>
	
<h4>Sizing the radar</h4>
<p>When you want to size the radar there are two options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Using &quot;radar autosize 1&quot;. This will automatically size the hud item so that it 
	fits the radar image at it&#39;s original size, the height and width of the hud item 
	is ignored.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Set the height and width manually. This will resize the radar picture so that 
	it will fit inside the hud item.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Opacity</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>radar opacity 0.5</dt>
	<dd>
	You can use &quot;radar opacity&quot; to set how transparent the radar picture should be 
	using a value between 0 and 1.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Player appearance</h2>
<p>The players are shown as circles with a line pointing in the direction they&#39;re 
facing. These are the settings that you can use to modify the appearance of they 
players on the radar:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>radar show_height 1/0</b>
	<p>Decides if the players relative height position on the map 
	should be shown or not. If this is set to &quot;1&quot; the players will change size 
	depending on if they&#39;re located high or low on the level. Otherwise the players 
	will always stay the same size.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>radar player_size &lt;value&gt;</b>
	<p>Sets the size of the player on the radar, if <b>show_height</b>
	is off, the players will be shown in this size at all times. If it&#39;s on, the 
	size specified here is the size that the player has when he&#39;s located at the 
	highest point of the level.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>radar fade_players 1/0</b>
	<p>If this is on the players will fade gradually as they lose health/armor, 
	this enables you to spot weak players easily on the radar.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>radar show_powerups 1/0</b> 
	<p>This will highlight players that has taken a powerup of some 
	kind (quad, pent, ring and suit).</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>radar show_names 1/0</b>
	<p>Show the names of the players on the radar.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Items</h2>
<p>You can choose what types of items that should be shown on the radar, if any. 
The following settings takes a string as an argument containing the items that 
should be shown on the radar. Any character chan be used as a delimiter, but if 
you use a whitspace character, remember to put the string in quotes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>radar weaponfilter</b>
	<p>Decides what weapons that should be shown.</p>
	Valid values:<br />
	<table border="1px" width="400">

	</table>
	<h5>Example</h5>
	<p><b>radar weaponfilter &quot;rl lg gl&quot;</b><br />
	This will show the rocket launcher, lightning gun and grenade launcher.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>radar itemfilter&quot;</b>
	<p>Decides what items should be shown.</p>
	Valid values:

	<br />
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Statistics</h2>
<h3>Statistics on radar</h3>
<p>During a match statistics such as what team holds what position of the map and 
where people die is collected. You can choose to visualize this on the radar 
using &quot;radar show_stats&quot;. It has 6 different options:</p>

<table border="1" width="350">
	<tr><th align="left">Value</th><th align="left">Result</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>Show no stats</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Show team statistics for both teams</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>Show team statistics for team 1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>Show team statistics for team 2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>Show death statistics for both teams</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>Show death statistics for team 1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>Show death statistics for team 2</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The color that is shown for the team statistics is calculated depending on the 
&quot;weight&quot; of a player when he moves over a grid in the map. A stronger player 
leaves a greater weight when passing over a grid cell. Each grid cell then has a 
weight for each team, and based on which team has the greater weight, that grid 
cell is colored in that teams color. </p>

<p>So basically when a team is holding a 
certain position on the map (has RL/armor/good health) they will color that area 
in their teams color, and it is obivous what team is dominating the map. For 
more information like this check out the <b>teamholdbar</b> and <b>teamholdinfo</b> hud 
items below.</p>

<h3>Teamholdinfo</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Teamholdinfo is a hud item that shows what team is holding specific &quot;important&quot; 
items on the map.</p> 

<h4>Radar interaction</h4>
<p>The radar can display the names of the items that are listed 
for the teamholdinfo hud item. This is handy if a map has more than one item of 
the same type, such as DM2 that has several YA&#39;s. If you want to know the name 
of the YA next to tele, then use:</p>
	<p><b>radar show_hold 1</b></p>
<p>to show the hold items on the map. Each item will be surrounded by a circle.
This circle is used when calculating which team that is holding that item. 
Basically all the weights inside of the circle are summed up and the team with 
the highest percentage of cells inside that perimitter is considered to be holding the item.</p>

<p>Tip: Create an alias for this, so that if you forget which item name corresponds to what item
on the map, you can just press a button and see all the item names.</p>

<p>
<b>alias +show_item_names &quot;radar show_hold 1&quot;</b><br />
<b>alias -show_item_names &quot;radar show_hold 0&quot;</b><br />
<b>bind k +show_item_names</b><br />
</p>

<h4>Filtering items</h4>
<p>The teamholdinfo hud item also has a filter option like the radar does:</p>
	<p><b>teamholdinfo itemfilter</b></p>
<p>which decides what items to show in the list.</p>

<p>Valid values are:<br />
<b>rl, quad, ring, pent, suit, lg, gl, sng, mh, ra, ya and ga</b>.</p>

<p>Setting different styles is also possible using <b>teamholdinfo style&quot;</b></p>

<table border="1" width="450">
	<tr><th align="left">Style</th><th align="left">Result</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>The team name of that holds the item in question is show to the right of the item name.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>A &quot;teamholdbar&quot; is shown for each item, with the percentage of the item held by each team.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>Two bars for each item is shown corresponding to the two teams hold percentage.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Teamholdbar</h3>
<p>This hud item shows you a percentage bar that shows how much of the level each 
team is holding at the moment.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>teamholdinfo vertical</dt> 
	<dd>Will draw the hold bar vertically.</dd>
	
	<dt>teamholdinfo vertical_text</dt>
	<dd>Will draw the text vertically when in vertical mode.</dd>
	
	<dt>teamholdinfo show_text</dt>
	<dd>Toggles the percentage text on or off.</dd>

	<dt>teamholdinfo onlytp</dt>
	<dd>Show only in teamplay or always.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Only in teamplay/demo playback</h2>
<p>Since these controls only works "good" during demo playback, and you most likely only want them visible when they're useable, there is a property that allows you turn them off when the game is not a teamplay game, or when not in demo playback:</p>

<dl>
<dt>radar tponly 1</dt><dd>Only show when teamplay is on.</dd>
<dt>radar tponly 2</dt><dd>Only show when in demo playback.</dd>
<dt>radar tponly 3</dt><dd>Only show when in teamplay + demo playback.</dd>
</dl>
