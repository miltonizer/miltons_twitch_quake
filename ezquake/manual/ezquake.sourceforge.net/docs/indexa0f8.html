<h1><a href="index.html">ezQuake Manual</a>: Startup and Configuration</h1>


<p>At a time of writing this page, very nice guide to start playing QuakeWorld with this client is available here: <a href="http://fquake.sourceforge.net/getstarted.html#step3">fQuake: Get Started</a>.<br />
We can fully recommend that page.</p>

<p>In the remaining part of this text we will explain you basics to run and configure the client after you have <a href="index19ad.html?install">successfully installed</a> it.</p>

<h2 id="startup-win">Startup - Windows</h2>
<p>If you've used the installer and during the installation process you've chosen to create Start menu shortcuts, go to the Start menu, select ezQuake &gt; ezQuake.<br />
If you don't have Start menu shortcuts, go to your Quake directory (the directory where you have installed or extracted ezQuake client) and run ezstart.exe.</p>

<p>This will start the OpenGL version of the client. If you have slow or missing graphics card then the Software version is better for you. In that case go to the installation directory and launch ezquake.exe.</p>

<h2 id="startup-linux">Startup - Linux</h2>
<p>Linux package is delivered with three binaries - GL/X (glx), software/X(x11) and software/console(svgalib) rendering. If you have capable graphics card (NVIDIA or ATI preferably) you would prefer to use GLX. Don't forget to have proper drives installed otherwise the game will run very slowly. In case of slow or missing graphics card X11 or SVGA version is better for you. If you dont have X installed, then you can run SVGA build only </p>

<p>Some configuration stuff happens in the command line. See the <a href="index03f3.html?command-line">Command-line options manual</a> for full list of available command-line options. Often used options are -width and -height. They do specify the screen resolution used in the game.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Once the client starts, you can toggle between the menu and the console using the escape key or your right mouse button. Go to the Options menu to set your preferences and save them on the last tab of the Options menu - Config.</p>

<p>The menus cover large set of settings you will usually need for comfortable enjoyment of QuakeWorld. However the console is the place where you type more specific configuration details and commands for your client. Console is bound to the <kbd>~</kbd> (tilde) key, use that key if you are in a game. In the console you can use <code><a href="index657f.html?help">help</a></code> command to enter QuakeWorld manual and <code><a href="index0d16.html?describe">describe</a></code> command which takes command or variable name as it's argument. So if you type <code>describe cl_gameclock</code> a manual page describing the gameclock settings will appear in the console.</p>

<p>To connect to a server go to the Multiplayer menu and select Join Game. A list of available servers should be gathered in a while for you. You can select different lsits of servers on the sources tab. Also you can use the connect command in the console to connect to specific IP adress, for example an IP that someone gave you and you have that IP in your clipboard, type "connect " and hit Ctrl+V and Enter to connect to that address.</p>
