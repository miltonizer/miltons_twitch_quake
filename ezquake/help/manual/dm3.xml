		<h align="center">DM3: The Abandoned Base</h>
		<br />
		<h>Introduction</h>
		<p>If there is one level that could be considered the grand-daddy of all teamplay maps, it should be DM3. Together with DM2 it was already present in the first public test release of Quake. Offering great strategic possibilities and an incredible amount of tricks to master, it has been popular since. Primarily used for deathmatch teamgames, other maps used for the same purpose - even in different games - have been compared to it.</p>

			<h>Important areas</h>
			<p>DM3 is really split in 2 parts where the main connection between them is in one central atrium. One side of the map contains the Quad, the three strongest weapons and the Yellow armor; the other contains only the two nailguns, the RA and a Megahealth. It is possible to get from the strong part to the weak part by another way, but this is not often used as it involves a few slow (and noisy) platforms. The Pentagram and one Megahealth are in this area however. The remaining Megahealth sits right in the middle of the level while the Ring is also placed centrally, right across the Quad.</p>
			<list>
			<li>
				<h>RL / Bridges</h>
				This area contains the RL in a small room with a window overlooking a water body. The LG is in the water right across the window while the GL can be found a short swim away. 
				A submerged tunnel leads to the outside area with the Pentagram. From the RL, stairs and bridges connect to the YA area and to a window over the Pentagram.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h>YA</h>
				The YA is tucked away in a dark corner close to the SSG. From this area a walkway leads to the Quad, and the other exit goes back to the bridges. Right behind the armor is a teleport that exits to the window over the Pentagram.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>Water</h>
				This area contains some healthpacks and the Nailgun which is the worst weapon on this map. The healthpacks here are usually needed to recover from fights in the other areas. What makes this area really interesting is that there are 3 respawn points which are very easy to control. There are connections to the low YA, the Quad area and the gallery leading to low RL and secret RA entrance. This area is often attacked first.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>Center and Quad</h>
				The circular central hub of the map is home to probably the most important item, the Quad. It sits on the balcony at the side of the RL and YA areas. On the opposite balcony, the Ring makes its appearance once in a while, every 5 minutes to be precise. In between them, on the lower level sits a Megahealth. 
				To summarize connectivity: all ways lead here. The YA, RL, RA, and Super nailgun are all located at about the same distance. Four high and two low roads even provide alternative routes to all.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>Warehouse / SNG</h>
				The warehouse is characterised by the presence of the Super Nailgun and (obviously) plenty of ammunition boxes. A megahealth is a few jumps away behind a corner. 
				From here to the Quad is but a short walk. Gettin to the RA requires navigating some tight corridors. In these there is a teleporter, which puts you near the Ring in the central area.
			</li>				
			<li>
				<h>Pent / outside</h>
				The imminent apparition of the Pentagram often leads to battles involving more then halve of the players in this huge outside area. A nearby Megahealth can aleviate some of the pain. 
				Getting to the Pentagram is no problem; just drop down from the window overlooking the whole area. Getting out of the area is different issue alltogether. It takes either a long swim through the tunnel to the RL area or a slow ride on a few elevators to the Warehouse. Or take the shortcut...
			</li>			
			</list>
			<h>Popular shortcuts</h>
			<p>Over the years DM3 has evolved from a huge map into an environment that can be navigated amazingly quick. Rocketjumps and other tricks to get around fast are essential for survival here</p>
			<p>To name just a few: jumps across the central area, from the Quad side to the Ring side; several jumps in the RA area to cut the time to reach in half; rocket jumps from the outside areas back to the high window; jumps from the bridge to the RL. The top players perform many, many more.</p>
			<h>Basic strategies</h>
			<p>The main strategy is simple: keep weapons, armors and Quad away from the enemy. The execution has changed quite a bit over the years however. Whereas people tended to just stay near the RL in the early days, teams now tend to focus a lot of attention on the RA. The Ring and especially the Pentagram that appear every five minutes can send a real shockwave through the game with more often then not over half of the players ending up in tiny bits.</p>
