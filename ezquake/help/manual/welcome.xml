		<h>What is this guide about?</h>
		<p>This guide is about QuakeWorld. QuakeWorld is an improved version of the original Quake developed by id Software in 1996. Quake/QuakeWorld looks back upon 5 years of development and evolution. It has a hardcore community of dedicated players, most of which are playing it for several years now. This makes it hard to get into it for new players. Nevertheless many people consider QuakeWorld to be the best multiplayer game today. Despite its old look it offers much depth and lots of fun. Thats why it is still being played today and why it's well worth to give it a try. However due to its age and the complexety on all levels it is very hard to get into and this is where this guide steps in. The guide will provide you with everything you need to know about QuakeWorld on different levels. </p>
		<h>Whom does it address?</h>
		<p>The QuakeWorld for Freshies guide adresses four groups of people:</p>
			<list>
			<li>
				<h>Newbies without any previous FPS experience.</h>
				We will explain to you what an FPS is, the general structure of playing an FPS and how to play QuakeWorld which in our opinion is still the best multiplayer FPS.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h>Newbies with prior FPS experience.</h>
				You have played the new, flashy and fancy games like Half-Life, Unreal or Quake 3. We will show you why we think QuakeWorld is much better. We will show you also how to set it up properly and how to play it, including general deathmatch, duel and teamplay strategies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h>Oldschool QW/NetQuake players.</h>
				You have already played either of the two some years ago and you are about to return to show the young bloods what Quake is all about. But the game is much different from the old days. We will show you how to bunny jump around the maps with insane speed, how to set up ezQuake and how teamplay is played today.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h>Active QW players.</h>
				Even though you play it there might be some useful info here for you. For example how this fancy forward rocketjumping script works or how to squeeze these extra 0.3 fps out of ezQuake-gl.
