		<h align="center">DM6: The Dark Zone</h>
		<br />
		<h>Introduction</h>
		<p>The Dark Zone has always been a classic 1on1 and 2on2 map. Its popularity as a map for teamplay differs alot depending on your location on the globe. While it is a true test of raw skills (aim, movement and predictions) for some, it is a messy chaos for others. Usually a match here is very action packed and exciting for the players, while watching a match here can be quite boring because of the frag, frag, kill, frag, kill, frag, frag style. DM6 is a very good map to play for less experienced players because it's easy to understand and play in comparison to the other classic teamplay maps.</p>

			<h>Important areas</h>
			<p>All games on DM6 evolve around controlling the RA area. Once that area is cleared, control is extended to the other parts of the map. Together with the RA you control one of the two RLs. The second one is on the other side of the map in a small room together with the megahealth. In the central area all other areas are connected on two different levels. The GL sits on the upper ledge and a shootable platform reveals the entrance to the LG room with the Ring.</p>
			<list>
			<li>
				<h>RA</h>
				The RA is located on the upper ledge of this area. Some stairs opposing the armor lead onto that ledge. Right in front of the armor, the RL can be picked up at the ground level. Under the stairs there is also the SSG. 
				Three ways lead out of this area. A small hallway across the RA leads into the center area, just like a longer and wider one. The upper ledge leads to the GL area but a gap along the side allows to drop down to the ground level. Right behind the RA, a respawn point is hidden in a tiny passage with two exits.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h>GL</h>
				From the ledge of the RA, a slope leads up to the GL. A wide circular ledge hovers high over the central part of the map. 
				Across the opening, a hallway leads to the stairs with the GA. On one side of the ledge there is a respawn point in the walls, on the other side there are some healthpacks. Looking down here gives a good view on most of the entrances the central area holds: the three ways to the RA, the upper and lower hallway to the stairs, the entrance to the LG and the tube to the megahealth room. The central teleporter can easily be jumped into from here.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>GA stairs</h>
				Two long flights of stairs along two walls of the room lead downwards. Both a SNG and the GA are located on the stairs. In the middle of the room there is a teleporter leading into the megahealth room. Next to the teleport, the only pack of rockets on this map is positioned. In a corner, another respawn point is hidden. 
				Besides the upper hallway to the GL, there is another one leading back to the center below the stairhead. The teleport serves as the exit for all other teleporters on the map.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>Megahealth</h>
				This is a small room that contains the second RL as well as the Megahealth. They are both right in front of the teleporter which goes back to the GA stairs. 
				A 'tube' leads from this room to the central area.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>Center</h>
				This center area interconnects all the other rooms. 
				In the middle of this rather large space, another teleporter leads to the teleporter in the GA room. In front of the tele lies the flimsy NG. Behind the teleporter is the secret entrance to the LG corridor.
			</li>				
			<li>
				<h>LG corridor</h>
				This secret corridor can be accessed by shooting a floorplate in the central area. Besides the LG and some ammo, the Ring also appears here. The teleporter leads back to the central area.

			</list>
			<h>Popular shortcuts</h>
			<p>The most common shortcuts are of course all sorts of rocketjumps up to the RA. Taking the stairs instead is slow and deadly. Skilled rocketjumpers can perform flat but long jumps form the long entrance directly onto the armor, often surprising the RA guards Multiple use of teleporters is also often used as shortcut. This "double' teleporting' sometimes results in telefragged teammates though. Bunnyhopping and especially adding speed to them through rocketjumps has also become common. For example it is possible to master the gap in the GL area with just one jump this way.</p>
			<p>One of the less common shortcuts involves a bug with the Ligthning gun platform. When someone hits it with the LG, it will go up in the air for a glimps of a second. With the right timing you can rocketjump to the upper ledge near the GL. A direct rocketjump from the center floor is very difficult and not usually attempted in matches.</p>
			<h>Basic strategies</h>
			<p>Both in teamplay and duel the basic strategy is to control and take the RA. Usually one or two guys camp there. Camping the other rocketlauncher is also a key to win this map. The fourth member of a team ideally covers some of the entrances (and respawn points) in the center from the GL area.</p>
			<p>Every five minutes the ring respawns and it is often used to attack and overtake RA. Due to the nature and the size of the map it is not possible to really lock it down except when the skill gap between the teams is very large. Therefore, games here are usually quite exciting with control and lead changing constantly.</p>
