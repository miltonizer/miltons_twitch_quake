		<h align="center">DM2: Claustrophobopolis</h>
		<br />
		<h>Introduction</h>
		<p>DM2 is one of the "big three" teamplay maps for QW. It is quite different from the other maps because it's quite small with its tight corridors and offers a lot more armor than any other map. Also respawns are quite easy to camp here. This often enables good teams to spawnrape their enemies and scores high up in the hundreds. On the other hand, DM2 is also famous for exciting comeback games which are decided by a few frags. The layout with the many switches, platforms, lifts and lava makes it very confusing to people new to the map but with a few tricks the dreaded lava is easily avoided.</p>

			<h>Important areas</h>
			<p>There are 3 important areas in Claustrophobopolis: The Area containing the quaddamage and an RL, the Nailgun/YA area where both a RA and a YA are to be found and finally the low RL area. All areas are well interconnected with at least two entrances . There is also a huge room where one can find another two YAs and which is often used to launch attacks on the quad area. The floor of that huge room can be removed temporarily by a switch reveiling the lava beneath it but doing so is both dangerous and usually useless.</p>
			<list>
			<li>
				<h>Low RL and Back room</h>
				<p>The room with the low RL is on the weaker side of the map. People often camp on the ledge just above the RL. There is a passage leading over some moving platforms to the huge hall. Another passage goed to a lift to the entrance oh the hidden RA and the gallery leading to the Nailgun area. The other two entrances lead to the back room. People in this area are very vulnerable to Quadruns.</p>
				<p>The back room contains a Super shotgun, some rockets and most importantly a RA and a Megahealth. One can get those either by pressing a switch wdich will create a bridge and going through the RL room to reach it or by jumping over to the ledge. There is also a teleporter there leading into the hall which is often used for escaping from Quad attacks.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h>RA Secret</h>
				This is not really a secret room because it's so easy to find. Shooting the switch opposite of the lift will open the entrance for a short time. Jumping down will give you the RA. The exit will open by walking towards it and leads into the shallow water area. This room is very small, good for ambushes or trapppings and infamous selfkills.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>Water</h>
				This area contains some healthpacks and the Nailgun which is the worst weapon on this map. The healthpacks here are usually needed to recover from fights in the other areas. What makes this area really interesting is that there are 3 respawn points which are very easy to control. There are connections to the low YA, the Quad area and the gallery leading to low RL and secret RA entrance. This area is often attacked first.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>Tele YA ("Telly")</h>
				Here we have a long stairway leading down to a switch. Behind the bars it opens is a YA and a teleporter leading to the moving platform to the GL as well as the high RL and the Quad. This teleporter is the main access to the Quad and therefore very important. With a box of rocket and some healthpacks in addition to the YA, this area is quite easy to defend.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<h>High RL and Quad</h>
				The Quad lies high above the rest of the surrounding area. Jumping across the gap into the tunnel will bring you to the second RL in the map. Near that one there is a huge and noisy lift leading up to the exit of the YA tele and the moving platform to the GL and a Megahealth. Beside that entrance there are two others, one passage to the large room and the other to the Nailgun area which can be partially controlled from here.
			</li>				
			<li>
				<h>Big room</h>
				The big room interconnects the low RL area and the Quad area. It is a huge symmetric area containing two YAs. These are in some sort of cages which can be accessed by a stairway. Within the cage there are switches which will temporarily remove the floor in the center reveiling the deadly lava beneath. This is not very usefull though because one can get out of the lava while the one in the cage is trapped. The only way out is through a teleport leading into the middle of the room and hence into hot oblivion. Additionally there are switches in the passages to the big room with which players inside the cages can be squished. High in the air there is a platform moving from the GL and Megahealth niche to the YA teleport exit.

			<h>Popular shortcuts</h>
			<p>There are plenty of shortcuts on this map. Usually they either involve strafe jumping or rocket jumps. One of the most common jumps and probably the first one every quake player learns is the jump over the lava from the low RL room to the back room. Getting to the RA and Megahealth there also involves a strafe jump over the lava to avoid having to press butons. Another popular jump is the shortcut to the low YA throught the columns confining that lava pool. One of the trickier jumps is from the high RL to the Quad.</p>
			<p>Rocketjumps are usually used to get to the Quad area without using the teleporter at YA. These are very common, but there it is also possible to rocketjump from the stairs in the big room directly to the Greande Launcher or the high entrance to the Quad area. Another shortcut is the so called "Quad ladder". Standing on the middle step under the Quad enables a teammate to jump on your head and to the Quad from there. This is often seen at the start of the map when players cannot rocketjump yet and sometimes its funny because an enemy accidently uses your help.</p>
			<h>Basic strategies</h>
			<p>Basically the strategy on DM2 is to control all three important areas Quad, Nailgun/YA, low RL and then respawn rape. But this sound easier than it is and requires good teamplay, skill and powerup/weapon/armor respawn timing. Usually one guy would camp the low YA thus locking the main entry to the Quad and a upper RL. But this position is quite vulnerable for attacks from the secret RA so someone should always be around to take this armor and to intercept attacks from the low RL and to help out at Quad if necessary.</p>
			<p>The Quadrunner is usually occupied with keeping the Quad area clean from attackers and attacking with Quad himself. The classic Quadrun leads into the low RL room where he would frag as many enemies as possible and then leave through the tele in the back room once Quad runs out. Last but not least someone tries to camp the low RL. His job is to take the RL whenever it appears and also to time the RA and the Megahealth in the back room. Locking the low RL is a major relieve for teammates on the other side of the map.</p>
